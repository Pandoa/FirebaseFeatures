# Cloud Functions
Cloud Functions for Firebase is a serverless framework that lets you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. Your JavaScript or TypeScript code is stored in Google's cloud and runs in a managed environment. There's no need to manage and scale your own servers.

## Call a function
To call a Cloud Function, you have to first retrieve an Https Callable Reference with the node `Get Https Callble`. Once the reference is retrieved, you can call it with a Variant data parameter.
